# Image to ASCII art converter

This is a JavaScript Image to ASCII art converter.

You can also *edit* the output in some ways. 

- First parameter is **offSetX** (could not think of another name. It is not actually offset.) It is how many pixels program jump horizontally.
- Second parameter is **offSetY**. Similarly, this is jump in vertical direction.
- Third parameter is actually the **line height**. Sometimes changing other params may result in bad image. So just twindle this one to get it right.
- Finally, hit convert.
- You can **copy** the ASCII art to clipboard.
